<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Obed, 24. Aspiring Software Engineer as a career. I had this dream of becoming a SWE since and before my completion of college education. 
  A learner of Angela Yu. Yu is a great instructor always telling the truth behind software development. I love her jokes, it never gets you bored always would want to learn. 
  She's always like this exercise is difficult but non of which I have come across is difficult. Maybe am yet to feel it (laughs). 
  TEAM EA SPORTS is my dream organization to team up with. I love this quote (DO HARD THINGS).</p>
